Enterprise Policy Management System

An AI-powered enterprise policy management system that helps organizations keep their policies aligned with government regulations, reducing compliance risks and ensuring seamless policy updates.

Why It Matters
Managing enterprise policies is a complex, time-consuming process. Policies frequently change due to government regulations, and ensuring compliance can be a major challenge. This system automates policy tracking, AI-powered analysis, and approval workflows, making policy management effortless and efficient.

How It Works
1. **AI-Powered Analysis** – The system leverages Google's Gemini AI to analyze policies, detect inconsistencies, and recommend improvements.
2. **Automated Updates** – Government regulation changes are automatically incorporated into relevant policies.
3. **Policy Version Control** – Track all policy modifications and maintain an auditable history.
4. **Approval Workflow** – Policy changes go through an approval pipeline to ensure compliance before implementation.
5. **Enterprise Dashboard** – A user-friendly interface to manage policies, approvals, and compliance tracking in one place.
